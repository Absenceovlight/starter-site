                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p class="move-text">I got into Web Development 3 months ago after watching some videos
                    about coding and have been
                    studying it since. I have learned a great deal of HTML, CSS, basic Python concepts and the basics of
                    JavaScript. I'd like
                    to learn reactjs when I get the JavaScript concepts down a little more.

                <h3>Music/Gaming</h3>
                <p class="move-text">I picked up acoustic guitar in High School and occasionally would play it
                    at school for my friends
                    and others. I really got into it cause my oldest brother was really good at it, it influenced me to
                    try my hand at it. I got really into video games as a kid growing up and they've been a big part of
                    my life since. I would like to look into some game design as a side hobby along my web development
                    someday.
